A friend of mine wanted to make a helmet with 3 cameras. The cameras are USB cameras that I am trying to connect to a raspberry pi 4. All the cameras have to do is write to video files (trying mp4) on the sd card.

This is for a proof of concept and any enhancement is welcomed.

# multicam
A rust project to detect camera's on a linux device (will be tested on raspberry pi 4 64bit) and save to video files for each camera.
